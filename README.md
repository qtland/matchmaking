# qtland Matchmaking Service (QMS)
The service is responsible for making a qtland server a qtland server with SourceMod.

## What is this?
This repo is created to store server config and misc plugins for archiving.

# Legal Disclaimer
qtland servers are purely replicating Valve matchmaking servers in TF2. Those matchmaking server configurations are open to SRCDS installations. There is gonna be obvious differences between a Valve server and a community maintained server.
